/*
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it.Your tasks:1.Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message iseither "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!"or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"2.Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark'sBMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"Hint:Use an if/elsestatementðŸ˜‰
