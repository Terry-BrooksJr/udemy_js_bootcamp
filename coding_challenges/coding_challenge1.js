/*Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height)(mass in kg and height in meter).Your tasks:1.Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables2.Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)3.Create a Booleanvariable 'markHigherBMI'containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.Test data:Â§Data1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.Â§Data2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
